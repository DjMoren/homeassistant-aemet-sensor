# AEMET Sensor

Sensor support for AEMET (Agencia Estatal de Metereolog√≠a) weather data service of Spain.

You need to get your "api_key" and find the nearest "station_id" at https://opendata.aemet.es/
in order to finish the configuration.

Install is available using [HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs) or you can install manually.

## Manual Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `aemet`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/aemet/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
